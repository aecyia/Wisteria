## Warnings

- Only use one recolour mod at a time! This will conflict with any other mod that changes the UI image assets and LAYOUT files. You can prioritize via "Resource.cfg" in your Mods folder.
- The colours may appear different based on your computer's brightness and colour settings. Especially when taking screenshots, it may come out as super saturated.
- Wisteria is built using
  - Steam version
  - The Sims 3 version 1.67.2.024037
  - With all the Expansion and Stuff Packs (except Sweet Treats)
  - Manual edits through a digital art software, and not through scripted / batch actions
    - As a result, some visuals may appear as their default image. Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/aecyia/Wisteria/issues) ♡
